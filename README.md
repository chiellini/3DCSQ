# CellShapeAnalysis


the code is built in hierarchical structure, one sub-dict is a package, the higher packages can use functions in lower packages.

## Files and Function usages

## Scientific Concepts

### Curvature Of cell

#### Gaussian curvature using libigl

https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/tut-chapter1/


**Principal curvatures**ï¼š the biggest and smallest radius of the points.

## Code Implementation

### Lineage tree draw
* generate the tree files with command first go to lineage_stat folder
```bash
    $ python generate_life_span.py  
```
1. this file would use function **construct_basic_tree** which would build a tree base on CD file with x position by cells' generation which time list is empty.
2. code in file **generate_life_span.py** would add cells' frames to the trees base on CD files.
3.  the CShaper embryo info, so i use embryo 06 to build basic tree in funcion **draw_PCA_combined**. 

* draw the average tree
    1. first, function **draw_PCA_combined** would construct a average lineage tree for all embryos.
    2. second, the function **get_combined_lineage_tree** would go through this lineage tree and get the frame cells' values depend on time/frame resolutions.
    3. third, at the drawing step, we would calculate all average value first and give cells values at different tp.
    4. fourth, we go through the tree again and do interpolation for the lost cells. 

* the legend frontzise is set at function **draw_life_span_tree**.
